## Anime-Capstone
This is the backend of my anime project I did for Actualize in their bootcamp.

## Installation
some installations I had to make was 
-cors
-bcrypt
-ruby on rails

## Project Status
This project works yes, I guess sort of, but for the most part its a very dry, boring start to what could be a beautiful project

## Acknowledgments
but thank you to my instructor Amanda as well as the TA's Keosha and Eric in helping me in not only this project but in previous projects as well

## Support
